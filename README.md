# ecommerce-project
 This is a simple e-commerce website created as part of my learning journey in a React course. The project demonstrates basic React concepts and functionality, such as:  - Fetching data from an API: Products and categories are fetched from a fake store API. - Component-based structure: The project uses reusable components like Product and ProductsList. - State management with Hooks: useState and useEffect hooks are used to manage and update component states. - Category Filtering: Allows users to filter products by category.  This project helped me practice core React skills, including component structure, API integration, and state management.
